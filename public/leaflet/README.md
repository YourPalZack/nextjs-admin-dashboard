# Leaflet Marker Images

To enable the interactive map functionality, please download the following Leaflet marker images from the official Leaflet repository and place them in this directory:

- `marker-icon.png`
- `marker-icon-2x.png` 
- `marker-shadow.png`

You can get these files from: https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/tree/main/dist/images

These images are required for the map markers to display correctly when the map feature is fully implemented.
